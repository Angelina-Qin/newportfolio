          <div class="section-content">
            <p>
              University help-seeking is fragmented and inefficient. Students rely on personal networks through messaging apps (WhatsApp, Telegram, Teams, Discord), but newcomers and international students lack these connections. Our preliminary research revealed two critical gaps: <strong>students struggle to identify the "right person"</strong> to ask, and <strong>response time uncertainty</strong> creates decision-making anxiety.

              <strong>Our hypothesis:</strong> A platform that combines public forum reach, private thread psychological safety, and direct 1:1 messaging—with clear credibility and availability signals—could bridge these gaps and create sustainable peer learning networks.

              Based on behavioral analysis, we identified two complementary user groups: <strong>Help-Seekers</strong> (primary) and <strong>Experts</strong> (secondary). Our research revealed that helpers typically respond reactively rather than proactively search for people to help.
            </p>

              <p><strong>Strategic Insight:</strong> Focus on optimizing the Help-Seeker experience first to generate demand signals, then use reputation systems and lightweight incentives to attract and retain Experts organically.

              The IA organizes around two primary user jobs—<strong>"Ask for help"</strong> and <strong>"Offer help"</strong>—with trust & safety woven throughout rather than relegated to secondary flows. This task-centric approach keeps navigation intuitive while supporting both public (reach) and private (safety) interaction modes.

              Evidence-to-decision mapping kept the team aligned and prevented us from shipping “nice-to-have” features. Prioritizing psychological safety early paid off in clearer flows and stronger adoption intent in feedback.
